	<h6><a name="FAQ4">What if there is not an open or available clinic during a time that I want to register a student?</a></h6>
	<p>Unfortunately, due to high volume and pre-existing agreements, we are not able to accommodate all requests. Please check back in the future to see if any pots become available.</p>

	<h6><a name="FAQ5">What if I registered a student for a rotation, but he/she can no longer attend?</a></h6>
	<p>You can do this through the same calendar that you used to initially register the student. Please see “New user instructions” document for details. If a student has to cancel a rotation, please do so on the calendar as soon as possible so that that spot may be available to other students who are interested.</p>

	<h6><a name="FAQ6">I received an email that a clinic that I registered a student for has been canceled. What does this mean?</a></h6>
	<p>Unfortunately, the clinic you registered for is no longer in session that day. Please go back to the main calendar you used to register the student to see if there are any alternative options available</p>

	<h6><a name="FAQ7">I still have questions. Is there someone I can call?</a></h6>
	<p>Please call our dermatology rotation coordinator at 404-727-3669 with any questions.  Please leave a detailed message with how we can reach you.</p>
